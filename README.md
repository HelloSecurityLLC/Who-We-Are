Welcome to Hello Security LLC, your premier remote cybersecurity consultancy based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. As a BBB accredited and award-winning international agency, we specialize in vCISO services and comprehensive cybersecurity solutions.

Our team is composed of the world's leading security engineers, cloud infrastructure technicians, and CISO industry professionals. At Hello Security LLC, we understand that cybersecurity is an ever-changing landscape. Hence, we are committed to navigating this complex field to deliver top-tier, adaptive solutions that provide the most effective path forward for your organization.

We are proud to be the cornerstone of the Hello Security Partner Provider Network (HSPPN), a unique, rapidly expanding global alliance of MSP providers, technicians, government agencies, engineers, and developers. This unparalleled network sets us apart from our contemporaries and fortifies our capability to address diverse cybersecurity needs.

Our mission is to empower SMBs and enterprise-level organizations with an array of services including vCISO (Virtual Chief Information Security Officer), OSINTaaS (Open Source Intelligence as a Service), SaaS Development (Software As a service), Custom SIEM and event management SaaS (Security Information Event Managers), penetration testing services, cloud security audits, overall organization security audits, cybersecurity readiness, awareness training, infrastructure audits, ethical penetration testing, and more.

Our expert team offers strategic insights to safeguard your organization's digital presence, operating remotely and part-time, offering flexibility without geographical boundaries. No matter where you are in the world, we're here to serve you.

Our vCISO service provides crucial operational and strategic leadership in information security. We understand that hiring a full-time CISO might not be financially feasible for all businesses. That's where we come in, providing high-caliber security expertise without the full-time commitment.

As the demand for seasoned Chief Information Security Officers skyrockets, many organizations struggle to secure these in-demand professionals. We bridge this gap, particularly for SMBs and Enterprise organizations, offering affordable, expert-led cybersecurity solutions.

The rising trend of CISO-less attacks is a reminder of the pivotal role information security officers play. We recognize the critical importance of these roles and are here to offer our specialized services, ensuring your organization remains protected in the digital landscape.

At Hello Security LLC, we work collaboratively with our HSPPN (Hello Security Partner Provider Network) partners to provide the necessary resources, expertise, and workforce any organization may need to secure their digital assets and prevent loss during a cyber event. We aim to mitigate potential profit loss from cyber threats, address active incidents, and provide scalable solutions without impacting your internal personnel, assets, or budget.

@HelloSecurityLLC as a github repository, was initially created to host a few test website templates / edits / etc. Essentially it is being used as one of many debugging stations. Ie in videogame development, a debugging level is oft added. This level oft contains all of the game's mechanics from all levels in one level so as to easily debug etc. Much like this repo, it has been created as a means of quick access on the part of debuggers, interested clients and the Hello Security Team. With this in mind, this repository may remain without much actvity for extended periods, and may not contain the full Hello Security LLC project catolog. This should also preface that the languages shown on this repo should not reflect all of the languages used or fluently incorporated in our project catolog.
